# Voting example dapp on Truffle Framework.

This is an example dapp on Ethereum local network using Truffle Framework.

We develop a dapp where the users can create proposals and vote them. Of course, they can vote once per proposal with the options in support, against or absence.

# Preconditions

This dapp is based on the official tutorial of Truffle Framework: http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/pet-shop. So, I strongly recommend to read it before.

You need to pay attention to configure and run Ganache (for a local blockchain) and MetaMask (for a client web blockchain).

# Deployment

* git clone https://github.com/bukosabino/truffle-voting-dapp.git
* cd truffle-voting-dapp
* npm install
* truffle compile
* truffle migrate --reset
* npm run dev

# TODO:

* Init and end dates to proposals.
* Anonymous users.
* Use Ethereum testnet and deploy demo
